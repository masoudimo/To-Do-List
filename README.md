# Frontend Developer Task

Welcome to our frontend developer task! This task is designed to evaluate your skills in React, TypeScript, and your ability to implement specific UI components. Follow the steps below to complete the task.

## Task Overview

You will integrate a feature to persist the to-do list data in the browser's local storage. The goal is to ensure that the data remains available even after the page is refreshed.

Behavior Requirements:

1. The to-do values should be automatically synced with local storage whenever changes are made to the list.
2. The synchronization to local storage should occur after a delay of 3 seconds from the last change.
3. On page load, the application should initialize the to-do list using the data stored in local storage, ensuring the user sees their saved todos.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (React, TypeScript, and any additional libraries you prefer).
3. Run the project.
4. Implement the required features.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Create a new branch with the naming convention: `dev/<feature-name>`
2. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
3. Push your branch to GitHub.
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main branch.
5. In the PR description, provide a brief explanation of your implementation and any decisions you made during the process.

Good luck.
